### Code Examples
DESCRIPTION:
In this kata you have to correctly return who is the "survivor", ie: the last element of a Josephus permutation.
```
function josephusSurvivor(n,k){

  let counter = 0
  let index = 0
  let soldiers = [...Array(n).keys()].map(x => ++x)

  while (soldiers.length > 1) {
    index = index % soldiers.length
    
    if (++counter === k) {
      soldiers.splice(index, 1)[0]
      counter = 0
      index--
    }
    index++
  }
   return soldiers[0]
}
```
